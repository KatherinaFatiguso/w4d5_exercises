        <!-- Make sure you're using meaningful classes so unrelated styles don't affect each other -->


        <!-- Make 6 200px square divs that all have different backgrounds -->

        <!-- Using the display property make them sit side-by-side on the page -->
        <!-- Now make it 1-per-line -->

        <!-- Now, what happens if you change the tag from div to span? Why? -->
        <!-- How about to a? -->
        <!-- Try a few others as well -->

        <!-- Create a 1000px wide, 500px high div. -->
        <!-- Position a div halfway along each of it's sides -->
        <!-- Now make the divs sit slightly outside so that they are overlapping the border of your parent, hint: you can use negative values -->
        <!-- Give all 5 elements a background and then make the parent overlap the absolutely positioned elements (hint: use z-index) -->
        <!-- Now make the div 5000px high -->
        <!-- What happens if you scroll? What if you change the position to fixed? -->

        <!-- Make a div that is 1040px wide -->
        <!-- Create 2 child elements, each 300px wide -->
        <!-- Make one of them sit on the right using the float property -->
        <!-- Now what happens when you give the left element float:left; ? -->

        <!-- Why does this happen? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16568272/why-doesnt-the-height-of-a-container-element-increase-if-it-contains-floated-el/16568504#16568504 -->
        <!-- Fix it by putting this AFTER your 1040px wide element: <div style="clear: both;"></div> -->
        <!-- Now fix it using this: http://nicolasgallagher.com/micro-clearfix-hack/ -->
        <!-- Now fix it the Bootstrap way: http://getbootstrap.com/css/#helper-classes-clearfix -->
