        <!-- NB: I've used 'grid' below to mean the number of columns in the layout. 'Columns' below refers to the 12 bootstrap columns. -->

        <!-- Bootstrap -->
        <!-- You don't need any css for this exercise, only Bootstrap classes -->

        <!-- What's the difference between these classes: .container .container-fluid (use Chrome inspector) -->
        <!-- What happens to the .container width as the screen size decreases? -->

        <!-- NOTE
            Rows must be placed within a .container (fixed-width) or .container-fluid (full-width) for proper alignment and padding.
            Use rows to create horizontal groups of columns.
            Content should be placed within columns, and only columns may be immediate children of rows. 
        -->

        <!-- Create a .row that is a child of a .container and see what it's default css properties are (use Chrome inspector) -->
        
        <!-- Create a layout that has 8 grid on desktop, 4 on tablet, and 2 on mobile -->
        <!-- Create a layout that has 12 grid on desktop, 1 on tablet, and 12 on mobile -->
        <!-- Create a layout that has 2 grid on desktop and 1 on mobile -->

        <!-- Create a layout that has 2 grid on desktop and 1 on mobile, and starts 2 columns from the left on desktop -->
        <!-- Create a layout that has 4 grid on desktop and has a separation of 2 columns between each grid -->


        <!-- Media Queries -->
        <!-- Remember: (these are called breakpoints)

        <!-- red text on mobile, blue on desktop -->
        <!-- square on mobile, circle on desktop -->
        <!-- 4 divs one on top of the other on mobile, 4 divs next to each other on desktop -->
        <!-- one image on mobile, another on desktop -->
        <!-- create a long paragraph of text. Make it shorter on mobile only. -->
        <!-- For each new breakpoint increase the font size -->
