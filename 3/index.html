    <!-- Make sure you're using meaningful classes so unrelated styles don't affect each other -->

        <!-- Create 6 square divs 200px wide, all with different backgrounds and display:inline-block;  -->
        <!-- Also give each div some text content -->

        <!-- Make it so that there is space between the text content and the edge of the div -->

        <!-- Make it so that there is white space between the divs -->

        <!-- Using border, make it so that there is only 1 div per line -->

        <!-- Remove the border and achieve the same result with margin -->

        <!-- Now do the same with padding -->

        <!-- Using margin, make the divs slightly overlap each other (hint: negative values) -->
        <!-- Can you do the same with padding? Or border? -->
